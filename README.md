# Isomorphic 90: A Generic Keyboard and MIDI Controller
This project is licensed under the GNU GPLv3.

This is a prototype for a future larger board.

## Features
- 90 hex-shaped velocity-sensitive keys
- Per-key RGB
- QMK compatible

## Technical
- 180 switches
- MCU: STM32F405ZGT
- LED driver: IS313741A
- RGB matrix uses external 5V power. This might not be necessary here, but will be in the larger board.

## Status
Both PCBs are nearing completion. Firmware code will be added here when it is time to implement.
